# journey-to-westros

### the task was to make a responsive web page that shows the feature of a country for tourism purposes but I made my own touch and converted it into a fictional journey inspired from the famous Game of thrones TV show and it's prequels. 
### the page is fully responsive and I developed it only as a training.
### it is just single page not a full website but I tried to add many features in this single page such as carousel, card, floating icons and grid system 
### I used Bootstrap 5 ,HTML ans CSS only in this page (the Javascript part here is only from Bootstrap)
